# CollabCollage
CollabCollage uses the Discogs API to search and compare different musicians' discographies to discover and chart all the collaborations and connections between their careers!

## To Do
CollabCollage is still in the process of being built, but there's plenty more to be done:
* Institute API request bottleneck
* Deliver data to create a real-time loading timer
* Implement local storage for recent search history
* Create back-end storage for larger requests
* Write a discography comparison algorithm
* Program an album art grid renderer

## Future Goals
* Get the site to search bands by their individual members
* Design light/dark mode
