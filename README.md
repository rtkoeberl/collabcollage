# CollabCollage
CollabCollage is a MERN app that interfaces with the Discogs API to search for collaborations between two different musical artists. You can use it to unearth unexpected intersections, trace creative partnerships, and visualize new aspects of your favorite artists' careers.

## In Progress
CollabCollage was initially built as a React app working with an external API. In the hopes of persisting certain data to limit API requests and avoid long load-times and rate-limiting snafus, it is currently being rebuilt as a MERN stack application.

## To Do
CollabCollage is still in the process of being built, but there's plenty more to be done:
* Institute API request bottleneck
* Deliver data to create a real-time loading timer
* Implement local storage for recent search history
* Create back-end storage for larger requests
* Write a discography comparison algorithm
* Program an album art grid renderer

## Future Goals
* Get the site to search bands by their individual members
* Design light/dark mode
