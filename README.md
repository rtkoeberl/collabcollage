# CollabCollage
CollabCollage is a MERN app that interfaces with the Discogs API to search for collaborations between two different musical artists. You can use it to unearth unexpected intersections, trace creative partnerships, and visualize new aspects of your favorite artists' careers.

## Future Goals
* Get the site to search bands by their individual members
* Weight releases by amount of collaborators present
* Design light/dark mode
