        <h3>Welcome to CollabCollage!</h3>
        <p>
          This website allows you to quickly discover collaborations between musical artists, using data from <a href="https://www.discogs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discogs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, use the search box to pick two or more artists, then run your search to discover if and when their careers crossed paths. To focus your search around a single artist's career, you can select the check box next to their name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of the data provided, CollabCollage cannot yet distinguish between performance and writing credits. As such, some results may be considered more "crossovers" than true collaborations.
